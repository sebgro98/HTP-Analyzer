This is our project for a product called HTP-analyzer (Humidity, Temperature, Pressure) for measuring
temperature, pressure and humidity. In our project we will use an ESP32 connected with a BME280 sensor
that can detect temperature, humidity and pressure. The ESP32 will be connected to the cloud using
Wi-Fi. This product will be able to measure the local temperature, humidity and pressure data which can be
beneficial in places such as a green house. The user will have access to these three values easily, compared
to something such as a thermometer which only measures temperature. The user will also be able to view
the data on a website and will be able to retrieve feedback from the data. With a wireless socket - it can
connect to a humidifier and turn on and off based on the users given maximum and minimum humidity
values.
